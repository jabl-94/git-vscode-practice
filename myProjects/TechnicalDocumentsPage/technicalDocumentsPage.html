                    GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

                    This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
                    
                    In this quickstart guide, you will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and use a repository</li>
                    <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
                    <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
                    <li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).

                        <p>
                            The installer will ask you for an installation location. Leave the default, 
                            unless you have reason to change it, and click <strong>Next</strong>.
                        </p>

                            specific need to change them and click <strong>Next</strong>.

                        <p>
                            The installer will offer to create a start menu folder. Simply click <strong>Next</strong>.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Select a text editor you’d like to use with Git. Use the drop-down menu to select Notepad++ 
                            (or whichever text editor you prefer) and click <strong>Next</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next step allows you to choose a different name for your initial branch. The default is 'master.' 
                            Unless you're working in a team that requires a different name, leave the default option and click <strong>Next</strong>. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            This installation step allows you to change the <strong>PATH environment</strong>. The <strong>PATH</strong> 
                            is the default set of directories included when you run a command from the command line. Leave this on the middle (recommended) selection and click <strong>Next</strong>.                             
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The installer now asks which SSH client you want Git to use. Git already comes with its own SSH client, 
                            so if you don't need a specific one, leave the default option and click <strong>Next</strong>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The next option relates to server certificates. Most users should use the default. If you're working in an
                             Active Directory environment, you may need to switch to Windows Store certificates. Click <strong>Next</strong>.                                                        
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The next selection converts line endings. It is recommended that you leave the default selection. 
                            This relates to the way data is formatted and changing this option may cause problems. Click <strong>Next</strong>.             
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Choose the terminal emulator you want to use. The default MinTTY is recommended, for its features. Click <strong>Next</strong>.                       
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            The installer now asks what the <code>git pull</code> command should do. The default option is recommended 
                            unless you specifically need to change its behavior. Click <strong>Next</strong>. to continue with the installation.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Next you should choose which credential helper to use. Git uses credential helpers to fetch or save credentials. 
                            Leave the default option as it is the most stable one, and click <strong>Next</strong>..                            
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The default options are recommended, however this step allows you to decide which extra option you would like to enable. 
                            If you use symbolic links, which are like shortcuts for the command line, tick the box. Click <strong>Next</strong>..                                                        
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Depending on the version of Git you’re installing, it may offer to install experimental features. 
                            At the time this article was written, the options to include support for pseudo controls and a built-in file system monitor 
                            were offered. Unless you are feeling adventurous, leave them unchecked and click <strong>Install</strong>.                           
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Once the installation is complete, tick the boxes to view the Release Notes or Launch Git Bash, then click <strong>Finish</strong>.

                    A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
                    Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. 
                    Often, repositories include a <code>README</code> file, a file with information about your project. 
                    GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. 
                    It also offers other common options such as a license file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your <code>hello-world</code>> repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

                    Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, your repository has one branch named <code>main</code> that is considered to be the definitive branch. 
                    You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to <code>main</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you create a branch off the <code>main</code> branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. 
                    If someone else made changes to the <code>main</code> branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This diagram shows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The <code>main</code> branch</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A new branch called <code>feature</code>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The journey that <code>feature</code> takes before it's merged into <code>main</code>
                        </p>

                <p>
                    Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>story.txt</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>story-joe-edit.txt</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <code>story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt</code>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our <code>main</code> (production) branch. 
                    When a change is ready, they merge their branch into <code>main</code>.

                    Now you have two branches, <code>main</code> and <code>readme-edits</code>. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.

            <p>
                When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new <code>readme-edits</code> branch, 
                which is a copy of <code>main</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
                Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
                Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

                    <p>
                        Click the <code>README.txt</code> file.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Click the <strong>pencil icon</strong> to edit the file.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Click Commit changes.

            <p>
                These changes will be made only to the README file on your <code>readme-edits</code> branch, 
                so now this branch contains content that's different from <code>main</code>.
